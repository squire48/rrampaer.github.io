## Imposible list?
Here is a brief yet clear description of this concept in the words of [@Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/)
> An impossible list is an ever-evolving list of experiences that build upon each other, help others as well as yourself, and implore you to take action.

The idea comes from [@Joel Runyon](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/), who created the worldâ€™s first impossible list.
