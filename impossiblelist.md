title: My impossible list

## Imposible list?
Here is a brief yet clear description of this concept in the words of *Thomas Frank*

> An impossible list is an ever-evolving list of experiences that build upon each other, help others as well as yourself, and implore you to take action.

The idea comes from *Joel Runyon*, who created the world’s first impossible list.
